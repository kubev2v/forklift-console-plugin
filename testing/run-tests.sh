# Script for running Playwright tests in a containerized environment.
#
# This script uses pre-copied test files from the local repository and 
# executes Playwright tests based on environment variables.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - CLUSTER_NAME: Name of the OpenShift cluster to target.
#   - VSPHERE_PROVIDER: vSphere provider to use for testing.
#   - TEST_ARGS: (Optional) Arbitrary arguments for the playwright command.
#   - CLUSTER_PASSWORD: The password for the OCP cluster.
#   - PROVIDERS_JSON: The content of the .providers.json file.
#   - WORKSPACE: (Optional) Jenkins workspace path. If set, artifacts are saved there.
#
# Output:
#   - Test artifacts are saved to ${WORKSPACE}/results (Jenkins) or /results (standalone).
#
